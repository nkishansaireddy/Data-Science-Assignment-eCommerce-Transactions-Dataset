As per the assignment titled "eCommerce Transactions Dataset," I worked with three CSV files: Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv. I downloaded these datasets from the Google Drive link provided in the assignment PDF and imported them into Google Colab for analysis. The tasks involved performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends, building a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers, and conducting customer segmentation using clustering techniques. This assignment tested my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and generating actionable business insights based on real-world data.
